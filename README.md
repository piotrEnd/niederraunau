**Information architecture:**

The webpages of German elementary schools are overflowing with information. My child's school is not an exception here, so I chose to structure the information architecture in my own way. Some sections have been merged, while others have been moved to different modules.

**Design:**

The current [website](http://www.gs-niederraunau.de/) appears somewhat outdated in terms of design. My suggestion is to adopt Material Design principles for the layout and color scheme, along with rounded fonts and a dynamic swirl pattern in the background. There is a sticky main navbar at the top and a helper navigation related to the specific section on the side. Each module is distinguished by its individual color palette. Made with the Materialize CSS framework.
