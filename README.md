**Information architecture:**

I get it - it's elementary school in Germany- parents expect information overflow. Still I have reorganized data presentation architecture. Some parts merged together, some were exported elsewhere.

**Design:**

Existing [website](http://www.gs-niederraunau.de/) is kind of outdated in terms of design and with that being said I don't mean that everything need to have corporate visual identity. My proposal is to use Material Design in layout and color, rounded fonts and funky swirl pattern in the background.
